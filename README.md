# PBFE 

## Overview

### Introduction

PBFE stands for [Performance Based Engineering for Resilient Food Industry](https://food-manufacturing.berkeley.edu/performance-based-eng-for-resilient-food-ind/). We aim at developing a food system management framework by combining Performance Based Engineering (PBE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to increase the efficiency, safety & resilience of agricultural production by improving food yield in terms of both quantity and quality, controlling crop diseases, decreasing resource consumption & waste, and increasing traceability. Traditionally, agricultural management is based on empirical judgement resulting from experiments & experience, which is no longer adequate because of increased complexity and added uncertainty of food systems due to the increasing demands of the world population. Thus, uncertainty quantification in food systems has been recently adopted. However, a robust framework is still lacking and this project aims at filling this gap.

### Results

We selected *drought* as the environmental hazard in phase 1. 

We developed the *Python* script for implementing the PBFE methodology by choosing the variables in the four phases.
